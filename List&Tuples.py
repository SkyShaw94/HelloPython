'''
List is mutable ie changes can be made
Tuple is immutable ie we cant make any changes
Both are 'list'
'''
# Defining Tuple () or direct assignment
x = 5,6,7,8
y = (8,9,4,56,2)
#Defining list by square brackets
z = [1,2,3,4,5]

'''
Tuple are majorly used for 'Sequence Unpacking'
Tuples are used where we know that
the data is not going to change or cases where
we don't want our data to change, plus Tuples
are generated and iterate through faster than a
Python list


List are more programming friendly and more
adaptive

We can access both like we access
array elements with indexing
'''

print("Tuple X Element 1: ",x[0])
print("Tuple X Element 1: ",y[0])
print("List Z Element 1: ",z[0])
